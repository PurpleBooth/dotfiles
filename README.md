# Billie's Dotfiles

![Image of my terminal](screenshot.png)

Mostly this is for backup purposes. It is all the important dotfiles to
make the terminal look like above.

I made an explicit decision with this repository to not follow good commit hygiene, or care about having a working pipeline. The aim here is to make something I can use very rapidly, not something for others to collaborate on.

## Setup

### Color Scheme

Manually install the theme
[DotGov](https://github.com/lysyi3m/macos-terminal-themes#dotgov).

### Install packages etc

To setup the home profile run

    make setup-home

To setup the work profile run

    make setup-work
