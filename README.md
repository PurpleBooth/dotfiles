# Billie's Dotfiles

![Image of my terminal](screenshot.png)

Mostly this is for backup purposes. It is all the important dotfiles to
make the terminal look like above.

I made an explicit decision with this repository to not follow good
commit hygiene, or care about having a working pipeline. The aim here is
to make something I can use very rapidly, not something for others to
collaborate on.

## Setup

### Install packages etc

To setup the home profile run

    make setup-home

To setup the work profile run
