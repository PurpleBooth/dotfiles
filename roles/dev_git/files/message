# Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes
#
# More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to
# about 72 characters or so.  In some contexts, the first
# line is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of
# the text as the body.  The blank line separating the
# summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body
# entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run
# the two together.
#
# Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
#
#   - Bullet points are okay, too
#
#   - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet,
#     preceded by a single space, with blank lines in
#     between, but conventions vary here
